Low-Latency Logger in C++

🧱What are we building? (Big Picture)

📌What is a LOG?
A log is just text + time. 
eg 1690000000000 [I] Order received

Imagine this 👇

❌ Normal Logger (Bad for NSE systems)
Your code → writes to file → waits → slows everything

✅ Low-Latency Logger (What we want)
Your code → drops message in memory → continues instantly
                          ↓
                  background thread writes to file


📌 Goal:
Your main program should never wait for file writing.

🧠 Real-life analogy

You write a note and drop it in a box 📦
Someone else later collects and files it 🗂️
You don’t wait → you move on.



Why We Need a Queue ?

You can’t write to file every time → it’s slow.
So we store logs in memory first.
This memory storage is called a queue.
